\begin{abstract}
The production of light anti- and hyper-nuclei provides unique observables to characterise the system created in high energy proton-proton (pp), proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions. In particular, nuclei and hyper-nuclei are special objects with respect to non-composite hadrons (such as pions, kaons, protons, etc.), because their size is comparable to a fraction or the whole system created in the collision. Their formation is typically described within the framework of coalescence and thermal-statistical production models. 
In order to distinguish between the two production scenarios, we propose to measure the coalescence parameter $B_A$ for different anti- and hyper-nuclei (that differ by mass, size and internal wave-function) as a function of the size of the particle emitting source. 
The latter can be controlled by performing systematic measurements of light anti- hyper- nuclei in different collision systems (pp, pA, AA) and as a function of the multiplicity of particles created in the collision. 
While it is often argued that the coalescence and the thermal model approach give very similar predictions for the production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions, our study shows that large differences can be expected for hyper-nuclei with extended wave-functions, as the hyper-triton. We compare the model predictions with data from the ALICE experiment and we discuss perspectives for future measurements with the upgraded detectors during the High-Luminosity LHC phase in the next decade.

\section{Introduction}
In the last few years A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) Collaboration has reported on the measurement of the production of light nuclei in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions at TeV centre-of-mass energies \cite{}, based on data collected during the first ten years of operations of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

\caption{Properties of nuclei and hyper-nuclei with mass number $A \leq 4$. $B_{E}$ is the binding energy in MeV. The size of the nucleus is given in terms of the (charge) rms radius of the wave-function, \rmsradius. The size parameter of the wave-function of the harmonic oscillator potential,  $r_{A}$, is chosen such that the measured/expected rms is approximately reproduced. Please note that the proton rms charge radius $\lambda_{p} = 0.879(8)$ fm \cite{bernauer10} is subtracted quadratically from the measured rms charge radius $\rmsradius^{meas}$ of the nucleus $\rmsradius = \sqrt{(\rmsradius^{meas})^2 - {\lambda_{p}^2}}$ to account for the finite extension of the constituents. Implicitly we assume here that $\lambda_{\Lambda}\approx \lambda_{n}\approx \lambda_{p}$.
 References are given in the last column. The spin of \hfourtwolambda\ is discussed in the text of~\cite{Nemura:1999qp}.}

\section{The coalescence approach}


Starting from the model described in~\cite{Scheibl:1998tk, Blum:2017qnn}, we have obtained in \cite{Bellini:2018epz} a generalised expression for the coalescence parameter $B_A$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:master}
	\boxed {  B_{A} = {2J_{A} + 1 \over 2^{A}} {1 \over \sqrt{A}} {1 \over m_{T}^{A-1}} \Bigl({2\pi \over R^2 + ({r_A \over 2})^2 }\Bigr)^{\frac{3}{2}(A-1)} } \;\;,
\end{equation}

\noindent which is a function of the spin of the particle $J_A$, its transverse mass $m_{\rm T}$, its size parameter $r_A$ and the source radius $R$.
Figure \ref{Fig:BA} shows the source radius dependence of $B_A$ for different composite objects, including the nuclei and hyper-nuclei with $A = 2, 3$ and 4 whose properties are reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:nucleusradii}.
